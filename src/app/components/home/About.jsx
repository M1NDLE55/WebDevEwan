            I&apos;m a freelance developer dedicated to crafting killer web and
            mobile apps. I value integrity, continuous learning, and a
            user-first approach, ensuring every project is not only modern but
            also makes your visitors feel at home. I love developing websites
            because I believe each one provides a unique experience and leaves a
            lasting impression on your customer base. My journey began with a
            Bachelor&apos;s degree in IT, and since then, I&apos;ve continually
            honed my skills through hands-on experience and self-improvement.
